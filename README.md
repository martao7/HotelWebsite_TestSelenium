# HotelWebsite_TestSelenium

Test automation of a website with IntelliJ IDEA and the Selenium Webdriver in JavaScript: https://qloapps.coderslab.pl/en/

This project is about creating a test automation for a hotel website. The aim of the test was to check whether the website user could register (create an account) and then add his address to his account without any problems. 

Using the IntelliJ IDEA development environment and the Selenium Webdriver, I create automated tests in JavaScript that I run in the Google Chrome browser. For describing individual features, I use Cucumber and Gherkin. The tests consist of page object patterns.

❑ Browser: Google Chrome

❑ Development environment: IntelliJ IDEA
